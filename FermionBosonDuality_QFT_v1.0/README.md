# Documentation for Fermion-Boson Duality and Quantum Field Theory Using an Extended Dirac Equation Calculations

## Overview
This repository contains Mathematica calculations and results for the investigation of fermion-boson duality in quantum field theory. The calculations demonstrate the application of extended gamma matrices and curved spacetime effects on various quantum processes.
